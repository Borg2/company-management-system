   This C program serves as a basic company management system designed to efficiently manage employee data. The program allows users to search for employees, add new employees, delete existing employees, modify employee information, and save changes.

   Features:
   - Search: Users can search for employees by their last name.
   - Add: New employees can be added to the system by providing necessary information, including employee ID, name, address,phone number, date of birth,  e-mail, and salary.
   - Delete: Existing employees can be removed from the system by specifying their employee ID.
   - Modify: Users can modify the information of existing employees, including their name, position, and salary.
   - Save: All changes made to the employee database can be saved to ensure data persistence between program executions.
   -print: Users can print all the employees sorted by salary, id, or last name

   Implementation Details:
   - The program utilizes data structures such as arrays or linked lists to store employee information efficiently.
   - Functions are implemented to perform specific tasks, such as searching, adding, deleting, modifying, and saving employee data.
   - Error handling mechanisms are included to handle invalid inputs.

   Usage:
   - Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu displaying available options.
   - Users can input the corresponding option number to perform desired actions, such as searching, adding, deleting, modifying, or saving employee data.
   - The program provides prompts and instructions to guide users through each operation.
   - Once the desired operations are completed, users can choose to exit the program, saving any changes made to the employee file.

   Dependencies:
   - This program is written in C and may require a C compiler to build and execute.
   - Standard libraries such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h are utilized for input/output operations, memory allocation, and string manipulation.

   Note:
   - This is a basic implementation of a company management system and may lack advanced features found in commercial solutions.
   - Users are encouraged to extend the functionality of the program as needed, such as implementing additional search criteria, integrating database management techniques, or enhancing user interface elements.
